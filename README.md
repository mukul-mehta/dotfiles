# Dotfiles

Configuration for the tools I most commonly use.

Each folder consists of configuration for that specific tool. I symlink these to the correct location to keep all of the configuration in one place (this repository)


### TODOs

- [ ] Add Install Script - Either a bash script or use Ansible
- [ ] Add configuration for VSCode, iTerm2 ands other apps
